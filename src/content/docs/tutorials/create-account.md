You don't need an account to play tricky-20, it is only used to save your
progress.

We use OAuth2 to create accounts and authenticate users.

1. Go to the [accounts page](/account) and log in/create an account.
2. Once logged in, generate an API key, and save it somewhere safe.
3. Use the API key to authenticate yourself, most API routes don't require it.

To see API routes that require authentication, read the
[API reference](/reference/api/).
