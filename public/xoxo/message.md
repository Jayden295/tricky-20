Hi!

My public gpg key is availible at:
https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/0C5DD2EC81B480717EE7C75BF3F812A5ED88A140

I'll send you a message signed with my private key so remember to add that to
your keyring okay?

I know your probably saying this is a little bit silly with the gpg keys but hey
this is fun, it's like we are cool hackers or something like that!

Wait that still counts as silly, whatever, I'm talking (or should I say writing)
too much, next message signed with private key, not using sha since technically
anyone can just intercept it, change the file, and update the hash you think you
got.

Alright, I'll stop for real now, remember that I'll sign the next message!
