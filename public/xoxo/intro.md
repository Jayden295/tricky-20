# hey!!!

i really didn't knew you were interested in cybersecurity and this stuff, this
is so cool

since you want to learn cybersecurity and that stuff i was like hey how about i
teach you like the basics of linux, usually in cybersecurity you interact with a
linux system, at least that's what I think so

just so you know i am NOT a proffessional, i dont even want to make
cybersecurity my career, but when you want to do coding/programming as a career,
well, you should know some cybersecurity

alr, if you ever have any questions or anything like that, just send me an
email, would be so cool if you sent it using pgp but errrr, i do have to say
doing that is complex

i'll be sending you other emails and things that explains you those
cybersecurity things!

## a little test

i'm like, how about i put a little challenge/test at every single email?

so here is your first challenge, i don't even know if you know how to do that,
and it's okay not knowing, i'm just doing that to attest your skillzzzz

here is your "homework" (omg i sound like a teacher lol):

`submit a variable named "solution" that contains the word "recursion" (case matters, all in lowercase),
your data should be formatted using JSON, and submitted though a POST request at
/api/v1/puzzles/tutorials/intro`

don't hesitate to ask me questions and see the tips!

see ya!
